<p>Starbucks Notebook 5</p>
<p>Without Other there can be no I. I is other to Other. I and Other are co-existent. Existence depends on this interplay. Without Other there is no context for I. How do I and Other come into existence? I comes from Other and Other comes from I. They co-arise. Neither is primary. They rise together. They define and create each other.</p>
<p>Neither can walk alone and separate. There can be no separate individual with separate destiny. Everything is intertwined. Everything is necessary for everything else to exist. Nothing comes before anything else. There is no hierarchy. Nothing is any more important or noble than anything else.</p>
<p>The things we label as good and bad, right and wrong, pleasant and unpleasant are all necessary to each other. Sides of a coin. Without the sides there can be no coin.  What exists? Does this mean we should not have any preference?</p>
<p>Life is like the sides of a coin. If we take a way the sides of the coin, what is left? Can one side exist without the other? One side defines the other. When we print a coin, do we make one side first and then the other? No. What is made, the coin or the sides? Can there be a coin without sides? Can there be sides of a coin without a coin? Which arises first?</p>
<p>Self is beyond duality. Self is empty of existence. Only I and Other experience existence. Dualistic notions like right and wrong, good and bad, pleasant and unpleasant are products of mind. Mind belongs to I and Other, not to Self. Self has no awareness.</p>
<p>I and Other experience preference. The intertwine between I and Other is host to infinite dreams. In these dreams all the dualistic notions play, creating infinite interpretations of existence. All pleasure and suffering is part of the dream. Only I and Other are subject to pleasure and suffering. Self is primary to all of this. Self is unaware of any of it.</p>
<p>Does this imply I and Other should strive to extinguish dualistic interpretations, to “rise above” pleasure and suffering?</p>
